Solving a generalized assignment problem by column generation and branch-and-price
==================================================================================

Problem Definition
------------------

Given a set of :math:`m` agents and :math:`n` jobs, the goal is to assign each job to exactly one agent in such a
way that the total cost is minimized, while respecting the capacity constraints of each agent.

Each agent :math:`i\in\{1,\dotsc,m\}` has a capacity :math:`C_i`.
Each job :math:`j\in\{1,\dotsc,n\}` has a resource consumption :math:`r_{ij}` and a cost :math:`c_{ij}` when assigned to agent :math:`i`.

We model the GAP with the following binary linear program:

.. math::

    \begin{align*}
        \min_{x} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij} x_{ij} \\
        \text{s.t.}  \quad & \sum_{j=1}^n r_{ij} x_{ij} \le C_i, && i=1,\dotsc,m, \\
                    & \sum_{i=1}^m x_{ij} = 1, && j=1,\dotsc,n, \\
                    & x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}, && i=1,\dotsc,m, j=1,\dotsc,n.
    \end{align*}

Decomposition
-------------

In this example, we use a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to break down the problem into a master problem and as many subproblems as agents.
The master problem coordinates the assignment of jobs to agents, while the subproblems handle the capacity constraints for each agent individually.

1. **Master Problem:** The master problem is responsible for ensuring that each job is assigned to exactly one agent. It maintains the overall objective of minimizing the total cost.

2. **Subproblems:** Each subproblem corresponds to an agent and ensures that the agent's capacity constraints are respected. The subproblems are solved independently and their solutions are used to update the master problem.

    abstract = {We present a new generalization called reliability branching of today's state-of-the-art strong branching and pseudocost branching strategies for linear programming based branch-and-bound algorithms. After reviewing commonly used branching strategies and performing extensive computational studies we compare different parameter settings and show the superiority of our proposed new strategy.}

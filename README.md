Idol is a powerful and flexible library meticulously crafted for developing new mathematical optimization algorithms.
It is built to provide researchers with a versatile toolkit to construct, tweak, and experiment with state-of-the-art
methods. Whether you're exploring Branch-and-Price,
Benders decomposition, Column-and-Constraint generation for adjustable robust problems,
or any other cutting-edge method, idol is your trusted companion.

Visit our [documentation](https://hlefebvr.github.io/idol/) and [benchmark](https://hlefebvr.github.io/idol_benchmark/GAP.render.html).

## Features

- Branch-and-Bound
  - Node selection rules: Best Bound, Worst Bound, Depth First, Best Estimate, Breadth First.
  - Branching rules (for variable branching): Pseudo Cost, Strong Branching (with phases), Most Infeasible, Least Infeasible, First Found, Uniformly Random.
  - Subtree exploration
  - Heuristics (for variable branching): Simple Rounding, Relaxed Enforced Neighborhood, Local Branching
  - Callbacks: User Cuts, Lazy Cuts
- Column Generation and Branch-and-Price
  - Automatic Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation
  - Soft and hard branching available (i.e, branching on master or sub-problem)
  - Stabilization by dual price smoothing

## Examples

Here is an example of a complex algorithm built using idol. It is a nested Branch-and-Price algorithm with strong branching.

```cpp
auto nested_branch_and_price =
        
    /* The overall algorithm is a branch-and-bound */
    BranchAndBound()
    
        /* Each node is solved with a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm */
        .with_node_optimizer(
                
            /* The annotation "decomposition1" is used to automatically decompose the problem */
            DantzigWolfeDecomposition(decomposition1)
            
                /* The master problem is solved using Gurobi */
                .with_master_optimizer(Gurobi::ContinuousRelaxation())
                
                /* Each pricing problem is solved by a (nested) branch-and-bound algorithm */
                .with_pricing_optimizer(

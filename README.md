Idol is a C++ library for implementing complex decomposition algorithms for
mathematical optimization.

Visit our [online documentation](https://hlefebvr.github.io/idol/) and [online benchmark](https://hlefebvr.github.io/idol_benchmark/GAP.render.html).

## Examples

Here is an example of a complex algorithm built using idol. It is a nested Branch-and-Price algorithm.

```cpp
auto nested_branch_and_price =
        
    /* The overall algorithm is a branch-and-bound */
    BranchAndBound()
    
        /* Each node is solved with a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm */
        .with_node_solver(
                
            /* The annotation "decomposition1" is used to automatically decompose the problem */
            DantzigWolfeDecomposition(decomposition1)
            
                /* The master problem is solved using Gurobi */
                .with_master_solver(Gurobi::ContinuousRelaxation())
                
                /* Each pricing problem is solved by a (nested) branch-and-bound algorithm */
                .with_pricing_solver(
                        
                    BranchAndBound()
                    
                        /* Each node is solved by a dantzig-wolfe decomposition algorithm */
                        .with_nodes_solver(

                            DantzigWolfeDecomposition(decomposition2)

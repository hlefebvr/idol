Idol is a C++ library for implementing complex decomposition algorithms for
mathematical optimization.

Its main goal is to facilitate prototyping new algorithms which
can exploit structure in optimization problems (e.g., Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, Benders decomposition,
nested approaches, ...) or to design complex algorithmic schemes for solving $\Sigma_i^P$-hard problems
(e.g., bilevel problems, adjustable robust optimization, ...).

**IMPORTANT: This library is under active development and has no stable feature (nor interface) for the moment.
Use it with care and with precise release reference only.**

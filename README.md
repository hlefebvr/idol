![Making Branch-and-Price implementation as easy as Branch-and-Bound + Column-Generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlefebvr/idol/main/docs/branch-and-price-implementation.png)

Idol is a powerful and flexible library meticulously crafted for developing new mathematical optimization algorithms.
It is built to provide researchers with a versatile toolkit to construct, tweak, and experiment with state-of-the-art
methods. Whether you're exploring Branch-and-Price,
Benders decomposition, Column-and-Constraint generation for adjustable robust problems,
or any other cutting-edge method, idol is your trusted companion.

## Examples

Look at how easy it is to implement a Branch-and-Price algorithm using idol.

```cpp
const auto [model, decomposition] = create_model(); // Creates the model with an annotation for automatic decomposition

const auto sub_problem_specifications = 
        DantzigWolfe::SubProblem()
          .add_optimizer(Gurobi()); // Each sub-problem will be solved by Gurobi

const auto column_generation = 
        DantzigWolfeDecomposition(decomposition)
          .with_master_optimizer(Gurobi::ContinuousRelaxation()) // The master problem will be solved by Gurobi
          .with_default_sub_problem_spec(sub_problem_specifications);

const auto branch_and_bound =
        BranchAndBound()
          .with_node_selection_rule(BestBound()) // Nodes will be selected by the "best-bound" rule
          .with_branching_rule(MostInfeasible()) // Variables will be selected by the "most-fractional" rule
          .with_log_level(Info, Blue);

const auto branch_and_price = branch_and_bound + column_generation; // Embed the column generation in the Branch-and-Bound algorithm

model.use(branch_and_price);

model.optimize();
```

## Implemented Features

### Branch-and-Bound

- Node selection rules: Best Bound, Worst Bound, Depth First, Best Estimate, Breadth First.
- Branching rules (for variable branching): Pseudo Cost, Strong Branching (with phases), Most Infeasible, Least Infeasible, First Found, Uniformly Random.
- Subtree exploration
- Heuristics (for variable branching): Simple Rounding, Relaxed Enforced Neighborhood, Local Branching
- Callbacks: User Cuts, Lazy Cuts

### Column Generation and Branch-and-Price

- Automatic Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation
- Soft and hard branching available (i.e, branching on master or sub-problem)
- Stabilization by dual price smoothing: [Wentges (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0969-6016(97)00001-4), [Neame (2000)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Neame%2C%20P.J.%3A%20Nonsmooth%20Dual%20Methods%20in%20Integer%20Programming.%20PhD%20thesis%20%281999%29)
- Can solve sub-problems in parallel
- Supports pricing heuristics
- Heuristics: Integer Master

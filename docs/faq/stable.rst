What features are stable?
=========================

We consider that a feature is stable when it has been tested and is working as expected.
This means that the feature has been tested in a variety of scenarios and has been found to work correctly.

You can have a comprehensive overview of the stable features by looking at the :ref:`functional tests <functional_tests>`.
A feature with "100%" coverage means that it has been tested and is working as expected.
